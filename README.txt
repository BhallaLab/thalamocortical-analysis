This project contains scripts for statistical analysis and figure
generation for the manuscript: Ray and Bhalla, "Cortical inhibitory
neuron number and synapse variability modulates network
synchrony", 2016.

R scripts require R with ggplot2 library installed.  Python scripts
require matplotlib, numpy, scipy.  Some of the scripts use simulation
data files in HDF5 format. For those you need h5py (and the data files
too).
